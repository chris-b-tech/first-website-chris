    <div><h3><b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – 
        <br>in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</b></h3> 
    <p>The tools I used in my website project was, visual studio code, trello and google search. 
    <br>Using Visual Studio Code, is a coding software which allows me to create different types of projects. 
    <br>It allowed me to code my website how I wanted it to look and what content I wanted to use. 
    <br>It does take some learning but once you have the basic's down you can start to learn more advanced coding. 
    <br>This was good for me because I got to learn how HTML and CSS work as it allowed me to learn new ways of coding and even gave me ideas of how I wanted the final look to be. 
    <br>With the help of some research I found myself getting better at using it and being able to spot errors more easily.
    <br>Trello is a free website that is easy to use. It allowed me to keep track of what and where I was in my project. 
    <br>Looking at code you can easily become lost on what to do next. So Trello allowed me to stay on track and keep pushing forward in completing my website in good time.
    <br>Research is always important as it allows me to see how a certain piece of code may work or give me inspiration for my website design.</p></div>
    
   <div><h3><b>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</b></h3>
    <p>Research was a really helpful tool because it gave me access to different ideas, designs and code I may have never have thought of. 
    <br>This was helpful for me because I didn't know too much about HTML and CSS coding. 
    <br>I didn't know how to add a navbar or make it move as the user scroll down the page, but some research allowed me to find a use for that code in my website.
    <br>Trello kept me on track a number of times. At times I would sit there looking at my code thinking what to do next. 
    <br>So I would open up Trello and see what tasks I needed to do etc. Or add any new tasks like creating a scrollable nav menu.
    <br>Visual Code allowed me to code out my website. This meant I had full control of what and how I wanted it to look. 
    <br>This gave me the freedom to try different things and experiment with it to see what would look good or not. 
    <br>Without this program I wouldn't have learnt how to code a basic website nor would I have been able to design it the way I liked.</p></div> 

    <div><h3><b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</b></h3>
    <p><b>Strengths</b>    
    <br>Navigating the website is easy and straightforward and it works well.    
    <br>Text is easy to read with the background image.
    It's clear, big and easy to read.    
    <br>The borders allow me/the user to easily 
    separate each section of text so it's easy to read and navigate through.    
    <br>Headers are also easy, clear and have some good spacing in between each section.   
    <br>It's simplistic and isn't difficult to use. Which makes it good for a lot of users.    
    <br><b>Weaknesses</b>    
    <br>As I mentioned, simplistic is good, but it's also bad 
    as it doesn't have much to keep a user interested in staying on the site for long.    
    <br>The background is a little stretched in some pages so it doesn't look the same on every page.   
    <br>Lack of pictures and colours. Not much to keep the user interested as 
    I chose mostly white and black colour palette.    
    <br>Needs something on the left and right side. It's a little empty there and doesn't look too good.    
    <br>Not much on the contact me page. Could of added a little more personality so it.</p></div>

    <div><h3><b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </b></h3>
    <p>There are many things I would like to improve upon.
    <br>An example of a design I like is <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/"target="_blank"></a>
    <br>I would like multiple backgrounds or even a video background.
    <br>I would improve the colour layout as it's mostly black and white, so it doesn't really stand out too much.
    <br>Add videos for reference instead of a link. Not all users enjoy a lot of text so a video will keep them interested.
    <br>Nice standout buttons that could take you to different parts of the site.
    <br>Improve the border so it stands out more.</p></div>

    <div><h3><b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b></h3>
    <p>After I got my website finished, I started making some small changes to tweak it and make it look better.
    <br>I added a white border around the edge. in the head and body.
    <br>Centred my photo a little more and moved it to the bottom of about me. Looks much neater.
    <br>I also moved the text in the paragraph over a little as it wasn't fully in the centre.
    <br>I removed the border around contact me as it didn't really fit well on that page.
    <br>I also adjusted some of the headers as they was rather long and went across the whole page.
    <br>I changed the text size for the menu as it was a little small.</p></div>
