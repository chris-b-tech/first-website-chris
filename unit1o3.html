    <div><h3><b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</b></h3>
    <p>Benefits:
            <br>There are many benefits to using IT for productivity and efficiency. 
            <br>IT allows us to connect to the internet and research, connect, upload and download files and many other things. 
            <br>This allows us to use different tools for different projects. For me I used Studio Visual Code, Trello and some research online. 
            <br>All of this was easily accessible right from my home, which meant I could work on my website at any time of the day without any issues and setbacks. 
            <br>This led to me being more productive and efficient because I could easily research some website designs or some code that I was stuck on in no time. 
            <br>It also allows me to communicate with my instructors in real time if I had any issues using slack.
            <br>
            <br>Drawbacks:
            <br>Some drawbacks with using IT is that errors do occur. 
            <br>Maybe a program you need to work has stopped working or the network is having issues so you can save your work to the server. 
            <br>These can cause setbacks in a project as you may need to restart a whole days worth of work because of a setback. 
            <br>Using a different pc or laptop can also be a huge setback, what if it doesnt have the necessary tools you need installed. 
            <br>This can cause a lot of time wasted in installing software needed to be productive.
            <br>But I do think the benefits do outweigh the drawbacks. S without IT some things may be impossible to accomplish.</p></div> 

    <div><h3><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</b></h3>
            <p><b>Track and limit how much time you're spending on tasks.</b>
            <br>Giving yourself a time limiton various tasks. 
            <br>Spending too long on a task can actually become counter productive. 
            <br>There are tools that can help by letting you know exactly how much time you spend on daily tasks.
            <br><b>Take regular breaks.</b>
            <br>It sounds counterintuitive, but taking scheduled breaks can actually help improve your concentration.
            <br>Taking short breaks during long tasks helps you to maintain a constant level of performance..
            <br><b>Set self-imposed deadlines.</b>
            <br>Giving yourself a deadline can also help. 
            <br>You may be surprised to discover just how focused and productive you can be when you're watching the clock.
            <br><b>Quit multitasking.</b>
            <br>Make a habit of committing to a single task before moving on to your next project. 
            <br>Otherwise you may find yourself with too many tasks to do and may lose focus on all off them
            <br><b>Take exercise breaks.</b>
            <br>Getting your blood pumping could be just what's needed to clear your head and get your focus back.
            <br>Giving yourself time to think away from the screen/phone etc.
            <br><b>Turn off notifications.</b>
            <br>Turn off notifications will allow you to stay focused on the task at hand and not get distracted by messages on facebook or instagram etc.

    <div><h3><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</b></h3>
            <p>To improve my own productivity I would plan much more effectively from the start.
            <br>That way I can see what needs to be done etc much earlier, rather than using trello after I already started some coding.
            <br>Make more use of slack by asking for advice on some code or web design and maybe they can also check over my code for any errors I may have missed myself.
            <br>Working in a team, have stand up meetings and communicate on slack with my team.
            <br>This would allow me to get a lot more done and have more time to improve my code. 
            <br>I can ask for help, spread the workload and bounce ideas of one another.
            <br>Take some short breaks.
            <br>I have a habit to not take any short breaks away from my screen and sometimes this can lead me being stuck for a while,</p></div>
            
    <div><h3><b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b></h3>
            <p>I would research the digital problem first to get an insight as to what is going on.
            <br>This can give me an insight on a solution.
            <br>After some research, I will then try and apply what I learnt into action.
            <br>The error could be as small as a missing file perhaps, or in visual code a simple syntax error.
            <br>In this case it would be a quick fix to the problem.
            <br>But in more serious cases it could be, maybe the program is receiving errors or will not run.
            <br>In this situation I would first make sure it is up to date.
            <br>If this doesn't solve the issue I would reinstall the program.
            <br>Then I would make sure there aren't any driver conflicts and they are up to date.
            <br>I would do a lot of trial and error to find a solution and record what I have done up until that point.
            <br>This will allow me to see what has or hasn't worked and will help me in finding the solution quicker in the future. </p></div>
