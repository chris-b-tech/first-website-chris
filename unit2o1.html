        <p><b>Layout:</b>
        <br>The layout is the same on each webpage to keep consistency.
        <br>Around the edge I use a double white border to fill in the edges.
        <br>I have a heading 1 at the top, which is the webpage title.
        <br>All the text is the same colour and style to keep it consistent.
        <br>For the navbar I used a dropdown box.
        <br>This allows me to hover over the Menu and select which section I want to go to.
        <br>The Menu scrolls with the user to its always accessible and makes the site easy to navigate.
        <br>I made each paragraph not align centre as this led to the text looking off.   
        <br>For each page I used heading2 to know what page I'm on and what content is there.
        <br>For each question I used heading3 without a border and made it align centre in bold.
        <br>Under each heading3 I used a double white border to separate each answer.
        
        <br>So instead I kept it on the left so it's easier to read.
        <br>The only 3 separate changes I made are. On the index page I made the title a little bigger as it's the first page.
        <br>On the main page I added a picture of me and placed a border around it in the center.
        <br>On the contact me page I removed the border around the paragraph as it didn't fit too well.</p></div>
        
    <div><p><b>Content:</b>
        <br>Index:

    <div><h3><b>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</b></h3>
        <p>Copyright is rights that the creator of a work is entitled to control, if the work is the users original work of authorship and not someone else's work. 
        <br>This means that in order to be entitled to copyright protection, the work has to be something you created and not copied from someone else. 
        <br>This has to be set down in some physical form e.g. like in writing, 
        <br>in a computer program or on a computer screen. 
        <br>These rights include: 
        <br>Distributing the work
        <br>Reproduce (or make copies of) the work
        <br>Displaying the work e.g. in a public place
        <br>Create derivative Works based upon the original work
        <br>Performing the work in a public place
        <br>For more information on Copyright <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/copyright-a-website-to-protect-it-4145788"target="_blank">here.</a>
        <br>Other constraints can be deadlines not met, due to poor planning, not enough staff.
        <br>Budget cuts can also affect a websites final outcome. This can force the website to undergo a lot of changes and may lead to a different end result,
        <br>not what the owner wanted.
        <br>These days there are a number of differnt browsers, so being able to make you website work on only one e.g. "Google Chrome" means the website may not run or display correctly on other browsers.</p></div>

    <div><h3><b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account -
        <br>describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b></h3>
        <p>There are many issues that may arise when someone with a disability uses a webpage.
        <br>Navigating the website may be difficult due to them not being able to read or even see the webpage.
        <br>So it will make accessing the website extremely difficult. There are a number of tools available to help with this.
        <br>The magnifying glass is an excellent tool as it allows people with low vision to be able to read much easier.
        <br>For someone who is blind there is also a screen reader which helps them to easily navigate the page, by reading the webpage out loud.
        <br>Another issue can be repetitive strain injury.
        <br>Which can be painful to use a mouse and to type for long periods of time.
        <br>Websites that function well with a keyboard only (no mouse) work great and vice versa.
        <br>But there can be problems when websites can’t be navigated by keyboard commands alone.
        <br>People that are deaf may have trouble with video websites like youtube.
        <br>Video and other media content are of no use if they don’t contain captions.
        <br>When media is captioned, audio is converted to text so it's readable.
        <br>Transcripts (written versions of the entire audio or video content) are helpful to.
        <br>This allows the user to print the transcripts and use them to study or viewthem on the go from there mobile phone.
        <br>Here is a <a href="https://accessly.io/website-accessiblity-truth-how-people-with-disabilities-use-websites/"target="_blank">link</a> with stories of people with such disabilities.</p></div>

    <div><h3><b>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</b></h3>
        <p>There are many different file types used for websites. The main two being HTML and CSS.
        <br>Without these two our website wouldn't work and we wouldn't be able to design it how we want. These are essential files.
        <br>For images the most common and widely used type are .jpeg and .png.
        <br>.jpeg is great because most photos are in this format. So it makes it great for websites like instagram and facbook.
        <br>.png is great because they are usually slightly smaller, and use features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support. 
        <br>This great for adding images into a website.
        <br>.zip Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed. This makes it easier to download multiple files all in one go.
        <br>.PDF documents can be transferred easily between computers and other platforms.
        <br>This great as you can use that file without having to start your own from the beginning.</p></div>
