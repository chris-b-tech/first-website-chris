    <h3><b>A Little About Me!</b></h3>
    <p>Hello, nice to meet you my name is Chris I'm 29.
    <br>I'm a gamer nerd. Rather shy at first. I have always been into IT so creating this website has been a lot of fun for me! 
    <br>This is my first time creating a website, so forgive me for it looking rather lame!
    <br>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
    <div><h3><b>Employment History</b></h3>
    <p>Wilkos - Customer Service 2018 - 2019
    <br>Banardos - Sales Associate 2014 - 2017
    <br>Cex - Sales Assitant - 2012 - 2013
    <br>Extra Care - Volunteer - 2010 - 2012</p></div>
    
    <div><h3><b>Why did you chose Codenation?</b></h3>
    <p>That's a good question!
    <br>As I mentioned I have always been into IT. So this was the perfect way to get into something I enjoy doing.
    <br>When I heard about Codenation, check them out <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">here,</a>
    <br>I was amazed at their website and courses available. 
    <br>I never thought I would end up coding a text base game and a website in such a short amount of time.</p></div>
    <div><h3><b>What hobbies are you into?</b></h3></div>
    <p>Another good question!
    <br>IT of course, I enjoy both sides of IT, the software and hardware side of things.
    <br>I built my gaming pc myself and helped some friends also with theirs.
    <br>I enjoy playing video games, mainly RPG games. I love Final Fantasy series, I would recommend you try them if your into RPG's.
    <br>I also play the guitar (which I suck at by the way) which I do enjoy. Writing cool riffs and trying to solo is so much fun!</div>
    <div><h3><b>Anything else you can tell us?</b></h3>
    <p>If there is anything else you would like to know feel free to contact me <a href="contactme.html">here.</a></p></div>
