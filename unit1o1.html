    <div><h3><b>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</b></h3> 
        <p> The purpose of IT in modern business allows a business to grow.
        <br>This allows them to connect to 1000's of customers or clients and it allows them to communicate with other deparments in the business.
        <br>This will allow each department to communicate and send work, etc. 
        <br>A company like Amazon uses IT heavily in their business.
        <br>This allows them to store, update information, reach new clients and customers etc.
        <br>Amazon ships out 1000's of packages a day. This allows customers to access their website from anywhere and make an order. 
        <br>This means Amazon doesn't need a store and can just use warehouses around the Country. 
        <br>Without IT this would not be possible and very practical.

    <div><h3><b>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</b></h3>
        <p>A successful digital project will have been planned out and each task recorded.
        <br>The first step would be to plan out what is needed in order to complete this project. Tools like draw.io and slack can be used to great effect.
        <br>If it's a team based project, zoom will be a big benefit as it allows multiple users online to be able to communicate the project and screen share which allows everyone to see that user's screen if they need help or have a question etc.
        <br>Trello is a useful website as it uses the kanban system, which allows users to make a list of 'To Do', 'Doing' and 'Done'. 
        <br>This will allow everyone the project to see what has been completed, or is still in progress etc.
        <br>Slack will allow users to message each other, share code with their peers and set up zoom meetings.
        <br>Being able to work in a team and solo work is essential to getting a project complete and successful.
        <br>Being able to use a multitude of different programs also will help in making a digital project successful.
        <br></p></div>

    <div><h3><b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</b></h3>
        <p>To plan out my website, I first started making some notes and ideas in notepad.
        <br>This gave me a rough idea of what I wanted my website to look like and what content it will have.
        <br>My next step was using trello. This allowed me to make tasks that I needed to do and keep track of them.
        <br>Trello link<a href="https://trello.com/b/LdwN87yC/website"target="_blank"> here.</a>
        <br>With my tasks ready I can start using HTML to code my website and start to think about how to design it.
        <br>Once I have the structure done I can start using css to edit fount style, colour etc
        <br></p></div>

        <div><h3><b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</b></h3>
        <p>There can be a number of reasons a digital project can fail.
        <br>It could be as simple as you forgot to save and closed the program you were using.
        <br>Maybe your laptop broke and you can't access your files. If it was a team maybe project it could be people not showing up for meetings, missing out tasks etc.
        <br>These are all risks because, data, work etc can all be lost which would result in starting again or the project being delayed.
        <br>Losing any data will ahve a big impact on a digital project.</p></div> 

     <div><h3><b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</b></h3>
        <p>It would all depend on what kind of job it is.
        <br>If it's a solo project in an office/home environment then you will be using a desktop pc rather than a laptop.
        <br>You may also need trello to keep track of tasks etc, but zoom or slack may not be needed as it's a solo project.
        <br>A project that requires you to be on the move will require a laptop and phone.
        <br>This will allow you to travel and still work at the same time and keep in touch with other team members or the client, depending on the job.
        <br>The type of software would also depend on the job. If you are building a website, using visual code would be a huge benfit and using html and css to design and code it.</p></div> 
        
        <div><h3><b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies 
            <br>have helped you achieve your outcomes.</b></h3>
            <p>Trello was a huge success in me achiving the outcome I wanted. 
            <br>This is because I had everything planned out visually in front of me,
            <br>as this kept me on track and focused on what to do next. Without this I wouldn't of been able to plan anything out.
            <br>This would of resulted in me becoming overwhelmed by everything and not reaching my deadline.
            <br>I chose to use HTML for the content side of things and CSS for the style and design.
            <br>This allowed me to code my website how I want it and display the content needed. It also makes it easy to make adjustments and add/take away code.
            <br>CSS allows me to style it excatly how I want it too look. By changing text size or adjusting where the text will be displayed.
            <br>Without using CSS I would not of been able to style my website or make micro adjustments.
            <br>Everything was codeded and editied in Visual Studio Code.
            <br>With this program I would not of been able to even start my website.
            <br>Github is an online website used to store the source code for a project and track the code.
            <br>It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools to use. These tools can be used by multiple developers.
            <br>This allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories.
            <br>It contains all of a project's files, as well as each file's revision history.
            <br>Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. 
            <br>GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration.
            <br>Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately.</p></div>
            
        <div><h3><b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</b></h3>    
        <p>GDPR is a data protection act which requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for any type of transaction in the EU member states. 
        <br>The regulation exists as a framework for laws across the continent and replaced the previous 1995 data protection directive.
        <br>The GDPR also regulates the exportation of personal data outside the EU. 
        <br>Breaching this will result in breaking the law, this could be a fine. 
        <br>Click <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr//"target="_blank">Here for more information.</a>
        <br>This can effect digital projects because, a business or user will not be allowed to post any content that isnt their own as this will be copyrighting.</p></div>
